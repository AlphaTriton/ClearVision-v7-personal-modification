<!--
Goals:
only supports visual refresh
supports both light and dark, along with dark variants
ensure all colour variables have some form of `calc(var(--saturation-factor,1) * $val)` in them
uses smallest css target possible
never use complex selectors before `> htmlElement` or `> *` without a very good reason
avoid usage of :has() without a good reason
always give reason for using `!important`
plugin support in extra files for respective client mods

sulfide :3

addons???

## Theme Editor

You can now customize the theme with a preview before downloading it to your computer.

Please keep in mind that **we do not manage the theme editor**, and cannot help with any bugs that come from using it.

## Installing

Note: ClearVision doesn't actively support plugins (as in, we don't seek out and actively theme fixes to every new plugin). However, when a plugin is widely used, we try our best to stay compatible.

**For BD and Vencord:**

Download the theme file from [our official support server](https://clearvision.github.io/join), [the BetterDiscord Website](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/ClearVision) or [releases](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6/releases) and move it into your injector's themes folder:

- BetterDiscord: `%appdata%\betterdiscord\themes`
- Vencord: `%appdata%\vencord\themes`

**For using the theme online:**

There are multiple ways to do this if your client offers using an online version. The suggested two are `https://clearvision.github.io/ClearVision-v6/main.css` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6/master/ClearVision_v6.theme.css`

For customizing the theme from there, you'll want to use custom css and add any variables you'd like to change. It should look something like this

```
:root {
	--main-color: red;
	--hover-color: yellow;
}
```

## Building from source

To build the theme from source, first install npm from the dependencies below, then you can run `pnpm install` to install all missing dependencies and `pnpm run build` to compile the theme into the `/public` folder.

### Dependencies

_From npm_
- [NodeJS/npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/pnpm)
- [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
- [PostCSS Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)
- [PostCSS CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-cli)

_From GitHub_
- [Sulfide](https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/sulfide) (Installation instructions in repo)

## Contributing

_This section is outdated._

You can run `pnpm run test` to compile the theme.
The `main.css` file will be in the `/test` directory, which can then be copied into your client mod's Custom CSS or placed in the themes folder and enabled in settings. Just make sure any other themes are disabled for testing.
